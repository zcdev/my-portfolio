JavaScript isn’t just a language. It’s a full dessert buffet of quirks, surprises, and contradictions.
Every developer eventually stumbles upon one of its mysterious flavors and wonders:

> “Wait… did that just happen?”

Welcome to the sweet side of JS, where logic melts, equality gets sticky, and `NaN` swears it’s a number.
Grab a spoon — it’s time for some weird but wonderful *JavaScript treats.*

## 🥮 Infinity Soufflé: Math with No Limits

```js
1 / 0     // Infinity
-1 / 0    // -Infinity
0 / 0     // NaN
Infinity - Infinity // NaN
Math.max() // -Infinity
Math.min() // Infinity
```

**Flavor note:**
The soufflé rises… and rises forever. Divide by zero, and it floats into `Infinity`.
But take Infinity away from itself, and you’re left with nothing but the mysterious `NaN`.
Mathematicians might frown, but in the JS kitchen, it’s just how the recipe goes.

## 🍩 Type Fudge: The “typeof” Paradox

```js
typeof null       // 'object'
typeof []         // 'object'
typeof NaN        // 'number'
typeof typeof 1   // 'string'
```

**Tasting tip:**
A reminder that JavaScript’s type system was baked in a hurry back in 1995.
The famous `typeof null` bug? Still on the menu, and probably always will be.
It’s a legacy flavor — like that odd frosting you’ve grown to love.

## 🍪 Equality Cookies: Sweet, Salty, and a Bit Confusing

```js
[] == ![]         // true
0 == false        // true
0 === false       // false
'' == 0           // true
null == undefined // true
null >= 0         // true
```

**Flavor note:**
JavaScript’s equality operators are like cookies baked in two versions:
`==` lets ingredients blend freely (type coercion), while `===` insists on exact measurements.
Swap one for the other and the whole batch tastes different.

## 🍰 NaN Pie: The Dessert That Isn’t a Number

```js
typeof NaN           // 'number'
NaN === NaN          // false
Object.is(NaN, NaN)  // true
isNaN('NaN')         // true
Number.isNaN('NaN')  // false
```

**Serving note:**
`NaN` proudly calls itself a number but refuses to equal anything, even itself.
`Object.is` is the only polite guest who recognizes it for who it is.
A truly existential dessert.

## 🍮 Boolean Brownies: Truths, Lies, and Maybe

```js
!![]        // true
!!{}        // true
!!0         // false
!!'0'       // true
!!NaN       // false
```

**Flavor note:**
Everything has a truthiness in JS. Even an empty array or object is *truthy.*
It’s the language’s way of staying optimistic, unless you’re `0`, `NaN`, or `null`.
Then it’s lights out for dessert.

## 🍫 Coercion Candy: The Shape-Shifters

```js
[] + []        // ''
[] + {}        // '[object Object]'
{} + []        // 0
[1,2] + [3,4]  // '1,23,4'
'5' - 2        // 3
'5' + 2        // '52'
```

**Tasting tip:**
When numbers and strings mingle, JS tries to guess your intent.
Sometimes it’s sugar, sometimes it’s salt, but it’s *always surprising.*

## 🍯 Operator Honey: Smooth but Sticky

```js
void (2 + 2) // undefined
+true        // 1
+[]          // 0
~[]          // -1
![]          // false
```

**Flavor note:**
Unary operators are JS’s secret sauce.
They may look harmless, but one drop of `+` or `~` can flip the whole dish on its head.
The `void` operator? Pure garnish, just for the undefined aesthetic.

## 🍨 Parsing Sundae: Toppings That Look Like Numbers

```js
parseInt('10px') // 10
parseInt('px10') // NaN
isFinite('0')    // true
isFinite('')     // true
```

**Serving note:**
Feed JS a string that starts with a number, and it’ll happily eat the digits.
But start with letters and it chokes.
A fussy dessert, but we love it anyway.

## ☕️ The Aftertaste: Why We Keep Coming Back

JavaScript’s weirdness isn’t a bug. It’s a flavor profile.
Every quirk tells a story about backward compatibility, quick decisions, and creative chaos that somehow still runs the modern web.

The next time `[] == ![]` makes your head spin, remember:
This is just dessert being dessert. Unexpected, messy, and a little magical. 😏✨
