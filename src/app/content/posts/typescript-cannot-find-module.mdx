# TS2307 “Cannot Find Module” 🌀 😵‍💫

While migrating my React + Vite project to TypeScript, I hit this error:

```ts
import "./styles/styles.css";
// ❌ Cannot find module './styles/styles.css' or its corresponding type declarations. (TS2307)
````

At first glance I thought: *“Wait, why is TypeScript mad about plain CSS?”*

## The Rabbit Hole 🕳️🐇

Instead of asking ChatGPT first (whoops 😏), I ventured into the Google Search wonderland: 16 articles, 7 search variations, several Stack Overflow threads, and enough document skimming to qualify as a speed-reading time travel maze.

The highlights looked like:

* *“Cannot find module …”* in Vite forums
* Stack Overflow on TypeScript + CSS imports
* `vite-env.d.ts` hack mentions
* @types/css-modules on npm

…you get the picture. Lots of scrolling, not much fixing.

## ✅ The Final Fix

After all that, the solution boiled down to **three simple steps**:

1. Install type definitions:

   ```bash
   npm i -D @types/css-modules
   ```
2. Create a `vite-env.d.ts` file:

   ```ts
   declare module "*.css";
   ```
3. Update `tsconfig.json` to include it:

   ```json
   "include": ["src", "vite-env.d.ts"]
   ```

And BAM 💥 — the error disappeared.

## CSS Imports: Two Paths

Once I got it working, ChatGPT showed me there are actually **two variations**:

| Approach        | vite-env.d.ts declaration                                                                                       | Usage                                    | Pros                        |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Global CSS**  | `declare module "*.css";`                                                                                       | `import "./styles.css";`                 | Simple, works for plain CSS |
| **CSS Modules** | `ts\n declare module "*.css" {\n   const classes: { [key: string]: string };\n   export default classes;\n }\n` | `import styles from "./App.module.css";` | Autocomplete + type-safety  |

So you can pick a path depending on whether you’re importing one big stylesheet or using `.module.css` files.

## Reflection 🤔

Would’ve been faster to ask ChatGPT first, but stumbling through the maze taught me a few things:

* How TypeScript handles non-TS imports
* Where `vite-env.d.ts` fits into the config
* That there’s a lightweight vs. strict way to type CSS modules

**Valuable lesson:** Still proud of my own adventure and discovery! 💪 Searching builds grit, yet with ChatGPT, it’s even more marvelous. 🤖
