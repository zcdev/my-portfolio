## Overview

This project is part of my personal portfolio rebuild initiative, where I transformed the legacy code I learned at UCBX into a modern web app using the most up-to-date tech stack. I rebuilt it from **React** `v16.7.0` to `v19.1.0`, enhancing it by improving accessibility, user interaction, visual design, and mobile-friendliness, while adhering to modern frontend best practices for accessibility, performance, and responsive design.

## Features
<ul className="list">
<li>Memory-based shuffled image recognition test with instant feedback.</li>
<li>Responsive 4Ã—3 (desktop) / 3x4 (mobile) grid layout.</li>
<li>Confetti animation on win using react-confetti.</li>
<li>Smooth animated message transitions with framer-motion.</li>
<li>Accessibility-conscious design (aria-live, semantic landmarks, screen reader support).</li>
<li>Freeze UI after win to prevent further clicks until restart.</li>
<li>Restart button with complete state reset.</li>
</ul>

## Implementation
<ul className="list">
<li>**Scaffolding:** Initialized with `React` and `Vite`.</li>
<li>**State management:** `useState()` used to manage game scores with a list of `12` owl images.</li>
<li>**Grid layout:** Owl images displayed as grid items, shuffling on each click/tap (desktop + mobile).</li>
<li>**Component structure:** App divided into four main components: Header, OwlCard, OwlGrid, ScoreBoard.</li>
<li>**Utilities:** Fisherâ€“Yates Array Shuffle Algorithm (from UCBX curriculum) implemented to randomize owl images.</li>
<li>**Animations:** `Framer Motion` for UI messages. `React Confetti` for the winning effect.</li>
<li>**Game end state:** On win, the UI freezes and owl images gray out.</li>
<li>**Testing & accessibility:** Evaluated via `Lighthouse` for performance and refined for screen reader and keyboard navigation support.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges & Solutions

<ul className="list">
<li>**File renaming on macOS:** Git ignored case-only changes (e.g., ScoreBoard.jsx â†’ Scoreboard.jsx). Solved with `git mv` to force rename.</li>
<li>**Async state updates:** React `setState()` didnâ€™t update immediately within the same function. Adjusted logic to avoid relying on synchronous values.</li>
<li>**State management pattern:** Replaced legacy `.concat()` with the functional `setState()` pattern for safer updates.</li>
<li>**Deployment fixes:** Vercel deployment succeeded once path resolution and casing issues were corrected.</li>
</ul>

## Performance & Accessibility
(Evaluated via Lighthouse)

<ul className="list">
<li>**Accessibility:** <span className="emoji-small">ðŸ’¯</span></li>
<li>**Best practices:** <span className="emoji-small">ðŸ’¯</span></li>
<li>**SEO:** <span className="emoji-small">ðŸ’¯</span></li>
<li>**Performance:** > 90 (App was image-based)</li>
</ul>

## Reflections & Learnings

Rebuilding *`Clicky Owls`* was a strong exercise in moving from legacy **React** to modern practices. I gained hands-on experience with functional components, hooks, and functional state updates, which clarified common pitfalls around asynchronous state. Working with **Vite** and **Vercel** highlighted the improvements in todayâ€™s developer tooling and deployment workflows.

A focus on **accessibility** taught me how to integrate `ARIA attributes`, semantic structure, and keyboard navigation as part of the core design, not as an afterthought. Using **Framer Motion** and **React Confetti** also showed how thoughtful animations can *enhance user experience without compromising clarity*.

Finally, **Lighthouse** testing reinforced the importance of performance awareness, especially around image optimization. This project ultimately helped me bridge the gap between older **React** patterns and modern frontend best practices.
