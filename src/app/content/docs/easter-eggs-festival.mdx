Welcome to the **Easter Eggs Festival** 🎉!  
This was a fun rebuild of my jQuery project into React, where I learned about state management, event handling, and sound effects.

### Features

- Unique eggs generated each round
- Win/loss sound effects with `useEffect`
- Responsive design with a reusable image component
