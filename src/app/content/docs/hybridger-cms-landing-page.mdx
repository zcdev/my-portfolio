## Overview

HyBridger was built to show how a professional-grade, production-ready web architecture comes together using `Next.js`, `Contentful`, `TailwindCSS`, and `TypeScript`. The project demonstrates real-world content modeling, `GraphQL` querying patterns, image optimization, and scalable UI composition, offering a practical example of how engineering and design systems integrate in modern workflows.

## Goals

<ul className="list">
<li>Build a high-performance headless CMS landing page</li>
<li>Demonstrate `GraphQL` querying and type-safe data handling</li>
<li>Develop a reusable component system for sections and UI elements</li>
<li>Implement a fast, predictable content pipeline (`Contentful` → `Next.js` → `Vercel`)</li>
<li>Create a scalable foundation that can support future expansion (blog, chatbot, additional sections)</li>
</ul>

## Architecture
HyBridger uses the `Next.js App Router` with a well-organized structure:

<ul className="list">
<li>Server components for headless CMS data fetching</li>
<li>Client components for interactive UI pieces</li>
<li>Centralized `GraphQL` utilities</li>
<li>Custom responsive image component</li>
<li>Typed data models for every query and CMS field</li>
<li>ISR revalidation through a custom API route</li>
</ul>
This ensures predictable data flow and fast render times.

## Features

**1. Contentful GraphQL Integration**

<ul className="list">
<li>Multiple content models: Hero, Features, Pricing, Testimonials, etc.</li>
<li>Each model mapped to `TypeScript` interfaces and section components</li>
<li>`GraphQL` queries consolidated into reusable utilities</li>
<li>Optional Preview Mode support for draft content</li>
</ul>

**2. High-Performance UI Sections**

<ul className="list">
<li>Built as isolated, reusable components</li>
<li>`Tailwind CSS` for rapid iteration & theming</li>
<li>Pixel-perfect layout engineered for both mobile and desktop</li>
<li>100/100 Lighthouse scores across performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO</li>
</ul>

**3. Responsive Image Architecture**

A custom `<ImageWrapper />` component delivers:

<ul className="list">
<li>WebP + fallback formats</li>
<li>Multiple resolutions via `srcset` switching</li>
<li>Dark/light mode image variants</li>
<li>Fetch optimization in `Next.js`</li>
</ul>

**4. CSS-based Animation Slider**

<ul className="list">
<li>Manually designed and calculated key frames for 3 slides with precise timing</li>
<li>Managed slides overlapping with delay, opacity, and transform/translate in a vertical/upward motion</li>
<li>Outputs are visually measurable and consistent</li>
</ul>

**5. Dark Mode Integration**

Images and UI elements use:

<ul className="list">
<li>Tailwind's dark class switching</li>
<li>Mapped variant sets for consistent theme behavior</li>
</ul>

## Challenges & Solutions

**CVE-2025-55182 — React Server Component Vulnerability**

During deployment, an industry-wide RSC exploit caused a failure in Vercel’s build pipeline.
The fix required upgrading:

<ul className="list">
<li>`Next.js`</li>
<li>`React` server rendering dependencies</li>
<li>Contentful’s SDK (to ensure compatibility)</li>
</ul>

Outcome: A valuable real-world experience in diagnosing and resolving dependency-level security issues in a production environment.

**GraphQL Type Management**

Challenge: Managing multiple queries and fields became complex as the project grew.

Solution: Consolidated all types and queries under a dedicated lib directory.

**Image Variant Complexity**

Challenge: Ensuring pixel-perfect image behavior across dark mode, mobile, and desktop.

Solution: Introduced a flexible prop-driven image component supporting multiple variants.
