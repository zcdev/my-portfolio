## Overview

The HyBridger Chatbot serves as a demonstration of how a reactive chat experience can be architected inside a CMS-driven site. It showcases controlled UI sequencing, timing logic, component-level composition, and user interaction constraints, illustrating how front-end engineering can create an engaging “scripted chatbot” without relying on AI infrastructure.

## Goals

<ul className="list">
<li>Build a clean, intuitive, scripted chatbot interface</li>
<li>Showcase component composition and message sequencing logic</li>
<li>Implement thoughtful UX for user input and linear flow steps</li>
<li>Provide a demo-level chat experience for the CMS site</li>
</ul>

## Architecture

<ul className="list">
<li>Controlled step-based script for predictable behavior</li>
<li>Message array updated instantly for smooth interactions</li>
<li>Thinking state separated into its own mechanism</li>
<li>Client components only</li>
</ul>

## Chat Flow Logic

The core behavior is driven by:

**1. Message sequencing**
```
setMessages(prev => [...prev, { from: "user", text: userText }]);
```
**2. Step progression**
```
setStep(prev => prev + 1);
```
**3. UX: Thinking delay**

Displayed using a controlled timeout:
```
setTimeout(() => setIsThinking(false), 2500);
```
**4. Fix for double-input issues**

Originally, `setStep()` was inside the timeout, causing race conditions when the user clicked rapidly.

Solution: update step synchronously, not after a delay.

## UX Strategies

<ul className="list">
<li>Instant user feedback (message appears immediately)</li>
<li>Isolate input from "thinking" state</li>
<li>Prevent repetition of triggers on double-clicks or fast typing</li>
<li>Randomized timing for script-driven responses for a natural flow</li>
</ul>

## Challenges & Solutions

**Managing State Across Multiple Components**

Challenge: Passing message state, step progression, and callbacks required careful planning to avoid prop drilling and maintain clarity.

Solution: breaking down each component's responsibility and clearly identifying the needs of associated TypeScript definition to improve organization and data flow orchestration.

**Sequencing & Timing Bugs**

Challenge: Delay inside state setters caused chat flow inconsistencies.

Solution: reorganize the event loop and thinking cycle to isolate UI delay from logic.

## This project demonstrates:

<ul className="list">
<li>Understanding how async UI delays can break interaction flow</li>
<li>Preventing double-input disruptors through careful timing logic</li>
<li>Structuring interface components for clarity and maintainability</li>
<li>Using step-based flows for scripted UI behavior</li>
<li>Practicing UI polish and message display consistency</li>
</ul>
