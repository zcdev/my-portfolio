## Overview

The Palaxy app was design and developed to merge art, logic, and play into a cohesive web experience that reflects the harmony between creativity and engineering. Designed for accessibility, optimized for performance, and fine-tuned for an interesting, unique, and out-of-the-world experience.

## Features

<ul className="list">
<li>Six original cosmic avatars with unique archetypes and animated intros</li>
<li>Custom designed avatar graphics and radically optimized images</li>
<li>Cosmic motion design using layered Starfields and Wavy Prism</li>
<li>Dynamic flow: Avatar Grid ‚Üí Avatar Modal ‚Üí Force Map ‚Üí Pulse Survey ‚Üí Transmission</li>
<li>Type-safe validation with Zod for robust form handling</li>
<li>Keyboard-navigable, ARIA-labeled interactive components</li>
<li>Perfect Lighthouse scores (100 / 100) on desktop and mobile</li>
<li>Vercel Web Analytics for real-time UX insights</li>
</ul>

## Implementation

<ul className="list">
<li>**Data:** Contained structured collections of avatar metadata, survey Q&A, and randomized ‚Äúcosmic quotes,‚Äù all defined in strongly typed nested objects.</li>
<li>**Types:** Centralized and organized TypeScript type definitions for global reuse across components.</li>
<li>**Form validation:** Utilized `Zod` schemas to handle both frontend and server-side form validation, ensuring consistent and secure data handling.</li>
<li>**Database:** Integrated **Supabase** for CRUD operations, backend management, and real-time data storage.</li>
<li>**Animation:** Leveraged `Framer Motion` to bring dynamic motion and depth to the interface‚Äîlayering animated Starfields and custom **Wave Prism** backgrounds for immersive interactions.</li>
<li>**Accessibility:** Implemented keyboard-navigable, ARIA-labeled interactive components to ensure inclusive design.</li>
<li>**Performance optimization:** Fine-tuned assets, layout flow, and animation rendering to achieve **perfect Lighthouse scores (100/100)** across Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO on both desktop and mobile.</li>
<li>**Analytics/UX insights:** Integrated `Vercel Web Analytics` for real-time insight into user engagement and behavior.</li>
</ul>

## Challenges & Solutions

<ul className="list">
<li>**Animation glitch:** Both Starfield and Wave Prism backgrounds initially caused layout shifts due to fixed positioning. Resolved by applying targeted `Tailwind CSS` adjustments per component and standardizing vector stroke widths and canvas dimensions.</li>
<li>**Layout consistency:** Ensured visual alignment and spacing across shared parent‚Äìchild components to maintain design coherence and responsive structure.</li>
<li>**Data, props, and type integrity:** Enforced numeric indexing for Avatar IDs and implemented `TypeScript` utilities (type extensions, annotations, and interfaces) for consistent and reusable data typing across components.</li>
<li>**Image size and LCP:** Optimized all responsive images for minimal file size while preserving quality, significantly improving Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) and overall loading performance.</li> <li>**Advanced Git workflow:** Used feature branches, semantic commit messages, and tagging to simulate production-level release management. Encountered and resolved merge conflicts and rebase issues to maintain a clean history.</li>
</ul>

## Reflections & Learnings

Building *`Palaxy`* was a challenging yet rewarding journey of merging design, psychology, and engineering. What began as a small experiment inspired by personality systems evolved into an interactive app that tested both my creativity and technical depth.

Working with `Next.js`, `TypeScript`, `Framer Motion`, `Zod`, and `Supabase` strengthened my ability to manage complexity‚Äîintegrating motion design, data validation, and UI flow into a cohesive experience. Through rapid prototyping and iterative refactoring, I refined component hierarchies, improved accessibility with meaningful ARIA labeling, and optimized rendering performance in the custom Wave Prism animation.

This project also deepened my understanding of data flow and full-stack integration, while reinforcing disciplined `Git/GitHub` practices through simulated release cycles and version management. Ultimately, Palaxy became both a creative expression and a practical exercise in building modern, accessible web experiences from the ground up.
