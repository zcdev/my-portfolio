            I‚Äôm a frontend developer and digital creative with roots in design,
            music production, and media. I specialize in React.js and modern
            JavaScript frameworks, blending artistry with engineering to bring
            design visions to life as interactive, user-focused products.
          </p>
          <p className="text-base mb-4">
            My background gives me a unique perspective: I think like a
            designer, build like an engineer, and create experiences that feel
            both functional and expressive. From enterprise platforms to playful
            UI experiments, I thrive on translating ideas into polished,
            engaging interfaces.
